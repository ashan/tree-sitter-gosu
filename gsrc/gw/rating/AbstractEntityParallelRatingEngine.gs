/**
 * This sub-class of AbstractParallelRatingEngine performs parallel rating using "Entity" objects
 * <p/>
 * Method rateInParallel() iterates over a list of {@link KeyableBean} entities, usually a list of {@link Coverable}s.
 * Because bundles are not thread-safe, each element in the list creates a new bundle for its own use and copies all beans
 * from the main thread's bundle to the child thread's bundle. The PolicyLine entity is copied to the
 * child thread's bundle and later that bean will be assigned to the AbstractParallelRatingEngine's ThreadLocal PolicyLine.
 * <p/>
 * Using an ExecutorService class from Java's Concurrent library, execute the specified rating code block in a
 * separate child thread. Within the parallel section of code, there are setup steps including initializing a
 * WorksheetLogger, setting a separate user authentication token, and setting the PolicyLine bean of the child thread's
 * bundle. Then the rating code block is executed.
 * Then there are cleanup steps including restoring the user token and finishing the WorksheetLogger.
 * <p/>
 * The rateInParallel method returns a list of Futures and we call handleFutures on each Future which handles
 * Worksheet exceptions if there are any.
 * <p/>
 * Note that if you want to use a NoCostWorksheetContainer to record worksheet information that is not associated with
 * CostData, then you should call the method
 * <p/>
 * {@link WorksheetContainerContentHandler#addWorksheetFor(EffDated, Worksheet, String)} on
 * _worksheetContainerContentHandler
 * <p/>
 * because this will take care of a possible race condition when multiple threads try to simultaneously initialize the
 * common WorksheetContainer.
 * @param E is a type variable that represents the {@link EffDated} on which rating is performed
